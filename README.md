## Tech and model used: ##

### Stable-Diffusion ###

Stable diffusion is a machine learning method that involves iteratively adding noise to an image while maintaining stability and coherence. This technique allows the model to gradually refine its understanding of the image without losing important features or details. By diffusing noise over multiple steps, the model can generate high-quality images with realistic textures and structures.

### Hugging face interface ###
Hugging Face is a leading platform for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for accessing pre-trained models, training custom models, and deploying machine learning applications. 

the model implemented for the project is: [*stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2*](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2)
